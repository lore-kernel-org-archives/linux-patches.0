6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: David Hildenbrand (Red Hat) <david@kernel.org>

commit 3937027caecb4f8251e82dd857ba1d749bb5a428 upstream.

Ever since we stopped using the page count to detect shared PMD page
tables, these comments are outdated.

The only reason we have to flush the TLB early is because once we drop the
i_mmap_rwsem, the previously shared page table could get freed (to then
get reallocated and used for other purpose).  So we really have to flush
the TLB before that could happen.

So let's simplify the comments a bit.

The "If we unshared PMDs, the TLB flush was not recorded in mmu_gather."
part introduced as in commit a4a118f2eead ("hugetlbfs: flush TLBs
correctly after huge_pmd_unshare") was confusing: sure it is recorded in
the mmu_gather, otherwise tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly() wouldn't do anything.
So let's drop that comment while at it as well.

We'll centralize these comments in a single helper as we rework the code
next.
