I'd be more inclined to do:

typedef unsigned int vm_flags_t[2];

and deal with all the fallout.  That'll find all the problems (although
leave us vulnerable to people forgetting which half of the flags they
want to be looking at).

Hm.  We never actually converted vma->vm_flags to be vm_flags_t.  Only
vm_region, which aiui is only used on nommu.
