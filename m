From: Andy Chiu <andy.chiu@sifive.com>

commit 9ddfc3cd806081ce1f6c9c2f988cbb031f35d28f upstream.

Runtime code patching must be done at a naturally aligned address, or we
may execute on a partial instruction.

We have encountered problems traced back to static jump functions during
the test. We switched the tracer randomly for every 1~5 seconds on a
dual-core QEMU setup and found the kernel sucking at a static branch
where it jumps to itself.

The reason is that the static branch was 2-byte but not 4-byte aligned.
Then, the kernel would patch the instruction, either J or NOP, with two
half-word stores if the machine does not have efficient unaligned
accesses. Thus, moments exist where half of the NOP mixes with the other
half of the J when transitioning the branch. In our particular case, on
a little-endian machine, the upper half of the NOP was mixed with the
lower part of the J when enabling the branch, resulting in a jump that
jumped to itself. Conversely, it would result in a HINT instruction when
disabling the branch, but it might not be observable.

ARM64 does not have this problem since all instructions must be 4-byte
aligned.
