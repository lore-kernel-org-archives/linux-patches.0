Hi Linus,

I don't think this is about micro-optimization. Rather, userspace RNGs
aren't really possible in a safe way at the moment. This patchset aims
to make that possible, by providing things that libc will use. The cover
letter of this series makes that case.

That's not what this patchset does. libc still needs to handle
per-thread semantics itself and slice up buffers and so forth. The vDSO
doesn't allocate any memory. I suspect this was Ingo's presumption too,
and you extrapolated from that. But that's not what's happening.

Actually, I was thinking VM_DROPPABLE might be a somewhat interesting
thing to introduce for database caches and so forth, where dropping
things under memory pressure is actually useful. Obviously that's the
result of a thought process involving a solution looking for a problem,
but I considered this a month or so ago when I first sent this in, and
decided that if I was to expose this via a MAP_* flag in mmap(), that
should come later, so I didn't here. Anyway, that is all to say it's not
like this is the only use for it. But either way, I don't actually have
my sights set on it as a general solution -- after all, I am not in the
process of authoring a database cache or something -- and if I can make
Andy's vm_ops suggestion work, that sounds perfectly fine to me.

Okay so that's where I think you're really quite mistaken. If you recall
the original discussion on this, I was initially a bit hesitant to do it
and didn't really want to do it that much. And then I looked into it,
and talked to a bunch of library and program authors, and saw that
there's actually quite a bit of demand for this, and generally an
unhealthy ecosystem of bad solutions that have cropped up in lieu of a
good one.

(I talked about this a bit with tglx at Plumbers, and I had hoped to
discuss with you as well, but you weren't available.)

Jason
