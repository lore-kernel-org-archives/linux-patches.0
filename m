[ Upstream commit 3de975862f985f1c9e225a0d13aa3d501373f7c3 ]

When a firmware IPC error happens during a pm_runtime suspend, we
ignore the error and suspend anyways. However, the code
unconditionally increases the runtime_pm counter. This results in a
confusing configuration where the code will suspend, resume but never
suspend again due to the use of pm_runtime_get_noresume().

The intent of the counter increase was to prevent entry in D3, but if
that transition to D3 is already started it cannot be stopped. In
addition, there's no point in that case in trying to prevent anything,
the firmware error is handled and the next resume will re-initialize
the firmware completely.

This patch changes the logic to prevent suspend when the device is
pm_runtime active and has a use_count > 0.
