For system calls that take structs as arguments we use u64 in the struct
for proper alignment so we can extend structs without regressing old
kernels. We have a few of those extensible struct system calls.

But we don't really have a lot system calls that pass u64 as a pointer
outside of a structure so far. Neither as register and nor as pointer
iirc. Passing them as a register arg is problematic because of 32bit
arches. But passing as pointer should be fine but it is indeed uncommon.

We try to avoid adding new compat-requiring syscalls like the plague
usually. (At least for new syscalls that don't need to inherit behavior
from earlier syscalls they are a revisions of.)

I think making this a size_t is fine. We haven't traditionally used u32
for sizes. All syscalls that pass structs versioned by size use size_t.
So I would recommend to stick with that.

Alternatively, you could also introduce a simple struct versioned by
size for this system call similar to mount_setatt() and clone3() and so
on. This way you don't need to worry about future extensibilty. Just a
thought.
