The security model is the same as that of random seed files, on, say,
BSD. If you remove the hard drive or change the operating system or what
have you, then sure, you can fiddle with the seed and read it. But the
running operating system shouldn't show it to you if it can help it.
Consider, for example, systemd's use of EFI variables for the
SystemToken. There, they have PID 1 take care of chmod'ing it before
other processes start.  But of course a different OS or even EFI shell
could just read it. So, think of this as just basic runtime safety --
like what people do when they set the umask before writing a random seed
file -- rather than some type of ultimate secrecy.

(And either way, the larger picture is that it's much more important to
get as much random data from as many sources as possible as soon as
possible, rather than being overly paranoid about every one single
source that we start excluding sources. A plethora of sources is better
off here.)
