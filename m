Have you considered extending rseq(2) per-thread "struct rseq" with an
additional "prng_seed" pointer field, which would point to a per-thread
memory area accessible both from userspace (at address
__builtin_thread_pointer() + __rseq_offset) and from kernel's
return-to-userspace rseq notification code (which can handle page
faults) ?

This way, the kernel can update its content when returning to userspace
if an update is needed since the last update.

Would that be sufficient as prng seed for your security requirements ?

Implementation-wise, the semantic of the prng_seed could be entirely
internal to a vgetrandom vDSO implementation, but the allocation of the
memory holding this seed would be the responsibility of libc.

libc could query the size required by the kernel for this prng seed with
a new getauxval(3) entry, e.g. AT_RSEQ_PRNG_SIZE. By doing so, libc
would only allocate as much memory as needed by the kernel vDSO
implementation.

This would remove the need for any kind of vgetrandom_alloc system call
and all its associated complexity.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
