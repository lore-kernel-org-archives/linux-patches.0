6.5-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>

commit 358ad816e52d4253b38c2f312e6b1cbd89e0dbf7 upstream.

Older PA-RISC machines have LEDs which show the disk- and LAN-activity.
The computation is done in software and takes quite some time, e.g. on a
J6500 this may take up to 60% time of one CPU if the machine is loaded
via network traffic.

Since most people don't care about the LEDs, start with LEDs disabled and
just show a CPU heartbeat LED. The disk and LAN LEDs can be turned on
manually via /proc/pdc/led.
