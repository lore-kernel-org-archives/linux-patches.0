commit e835c0a4e23c38531dcee5ef77e8d1cf462658c7 upstream.

Commit c4a5153e87fd ("usb: dwc3: core: Power-off core/PHYs on
system_suspend in host mode") replaces check for HOST only dr_mode with
current_dr_role. But during booting, the current_dr_role isn't
initialized, thus the device side reset is always issued even if dwc3
was configured as host-only. What's more, on some platforms with host
only dwc3, aways issuing device side reset by accessing device register
block can cause kernel panic.

Fixes: c4a5153e87fd ("usb: dwc3: core: Power-off core/PHYs on system_suspend in host mode")
